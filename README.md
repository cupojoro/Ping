Crowd sourced game map data.


Hi there,

This is a hobby project of mine that has slowly been evolving over the last couple of months. Due to work, I tend to either
spend hours daily on this project or can't touch it for a week or two.

I would love for any help or interest people may have as I am just a hobbyist programmer and always appreciate to learn from
the talented.

Cheers,
Joe Ross

By providing custom maps, like those that you would find in a game walkthrough, allow users/gamers to contribute and build a 
crowd-sourced 'map walkthrough'. This draws together the community and provides a method for grasping that ever so difficult
100% in games. 


Notes:
A lot of the values/paths are hard coded for debugging purposes.
The database and storage is hosted through Firebase.
The Firebase organization is denormalized so if interested shoot me a message and I'll break it down for you.
Currently trying to clean up the code. (I like to pump code out to make sure the idea is down and then clean up)
